## Deployment Validation Procedures

### Production Smoke Tests
```python
# deployment/validation/smoke_tests.py
```
**Critical Path Validation:**
```python
def validate_production_deployment():
    """Comprehensive production validation suite"""
    
    # 1. Service availability
    assert check_service_health() == "healthy"
    
    # 2. API functionality
    assert test_api_endpoints() == "passing"
    
    # 3. Performance validation
    assert validate_performance_targets() == "meeting_sla"
    
    # 4. Security validation
    assert security_scan_results() == "passing"
    
    # 5. Monitoring validation
    assert monitoring_systems_operational() == "fully_operational"
```

### Performance Validation in Production
```python
def validate_production_performance():
    """Validate PRD targets in production environment"""
    
    # Similarity computation performance
    similarity_latency = measure_similarity_computation_latency()
    assert similarity_latency < 100  # PRD: <100ms
    
    # Batch reranking performance
    batch_latency = measure_batch_reranking_latency(50)
    assert batch_latency < 500  # PRD: <500ms
    
    # Memory usage validation
    memory_usage = measure_memory_usage_with_100_docs()
    assert memory_usage < 2.0  # PRD: <2GB
    
    # Accuracy validation
    accuracy_improvement = measure_accuracy_improvement()
    assert accuracy_improvement >= 0.10  # PRD: 10-20% improvement
```

## Operational Procedures

# operations/monitoring_setup.yaml
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - name: "response_time"
      threshold: "500ms"
      severity: "warning"
    - name: "error_rate"
      threshold: "1%"
      severity: "critical"

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated alerting or manual discovery
2. **Assessment**: Severity determination and impact analysis
3. **Response**: Immediate action and escalation if needed
4. **Resolution**: Root cause analysis and permanent fix
5. **Post-Incident**: Review and process improvement
```

## Maintenance and Updates

3. Automatic rollback on failure detection
4. Performance validation during update
5. Post-update smoke testing

### Configuration Updates
```python
# operations/config_update.py
```
**Safe Configuration Changes:**
1. Configuration validation in staging
2. Gradual rollout with monitoring
3. Rollback capability for all changes
4. Audit logging for all modifications
5. Performance impact assessment
