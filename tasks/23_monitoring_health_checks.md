# Task 23: Monitoring and Health Checks

## Objective
Implement comprehensive monitoring, health checks, and observability features to ensure production reliability and performance tracking aligned with PRD targets.

## Prerequisites
- Task 20: FastAPI Service Architecture completed
- Task 22: Authentication and Rate Limiting completed
- Task 08: Performance Benchmarking Framework ready
- Task 09: Error Handling and Logging system operational

## Technical Reference
- **PRD Section 4.3**: Performance Targets monitoring
- **PRD Section 6.2**: Implementation Confidence validation
- **PRD Section 7.2**: Success Criteria tracking
- **Documentation**: "Comprehensive FastAPI Documentation for Quantum-In.md" (monitoring sections)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Health Check System
```python
# quantum_rerank/api/health/health_checks.py
```
**Health Check Categories (Simplified for V1):**
- **Basic Health**: Service availability and responsiveness
- **Component Health**: Quantum engine, ML models, FAISS status

**Health Check Endpoints (Simplified for V1):**
- `GET /health`: Basic liveness check
- `GET /health/ready`: Readiness probe for orchestrators

### 2. Performance Metrics Collection
```python
# quantum_rerank/monitoring/metrics_collector.py
```
**PRD Target Metrics:**
- Similarity computation time (<100ms target)
- Batch processing time (<500ms target)
- Memory usage (<2GB for 100 docs target)
- Accuracy improvement (10-20% over cosine target)

**Operational Metrics:**
- Request rate and patterns
- Error rates by endpoint and type
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Rate limiting violation frequency
- Cache hit/miss ratios

### 3. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
```python
# quantum_rerank/monitoring/apm_integration.py
```
**Performance Tracking:**
- Request tracing and timing
- Component-level performance breakdown
- Quantum vs classical method comparison
- Resource utilization patterns
- Bottleneck identification

**APM Integration Options:**
- Prometheus metrics exposition
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Custom metrics dashboard
- External APM service integration

### 4. Alerting and Notification System
```python
# quantum_rerank/monitoring/alerting.py
```
**Alert Conditions:**
- Performance degradation beyond PRD targets
- Error rate spikes above thresholds
- Resource usage approaching limits
- Component failures or unavailability
- Security incidents and authentication failures

**Alert Severity Levels:**
- **Critical**: Service unavailable or major performance issues
- **Warning**: Performance degradation or error rate increases
- **Info**: Normal operational events and milestones

### 5. Observability Dashboard
```python
# quantum_rerank/monitoring/dashboard.py
```
**Dashboard Components:**
- Real-time performance metrics
- PRD target compliance tracking
- Error rate and incident tracking
- Resource utilization visualization
- Quantum vs classical method comparison

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- Service availability percentage
- Average response time trends
- Error rate by endpoint
- User satisfaction metrics
- Resource efficiency indicators
