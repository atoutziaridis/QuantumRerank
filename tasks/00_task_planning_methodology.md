# QuantumRerank Task Planning Methodology

## Planning Philosophy

Based on the PRD analysis and technical documentation, I will create tasks that are:

1. **Modular**: Each task is self-contained and testable
2. **Functional**: Focus on working code components
3. **Step-by-step**: Clear progression from simple to complex
4. **Documentation-driven**: Every component references the technical docs
5. **Incremental**: Build and test as we go

## Task Structure Template

Each task will follow this structure:
```
# Task [Number]: [Component Name]

## Objective
Clear, specific goal

## Prerequisites
- Previous tasks that must be completed
- Dependencies that must be installed

## Technical Reference
- Relevant PRD sections
- Documentation files to consult
- Research papers to reference

## Implementation Steps
1. Step-by-step breakdown
2. Code snippets and examples
3. Testing criteria

## Success Criteria
- Functional requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration requirements

## Files to Create/Modify
- Specific file paths
- Expected file structure

## Testing & Validation
- How to test the component
- Expected outputs
- Performance verification
```

## Phase-Based Task Generation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 01-10)
**Goal**: Basic quantum simulation engine
- Environment setup
- Qiskit/PennyLane integration
- Basic quantum circuits
- Simple similarity computation

### Phase 2: Core Engine (Tasks 11-20)
**Goal**: Working similarity engine
- Embedding integration
- SWAP test implementation
- Quantum parameter prediction
- Batch processing basics

### Phase 3: Optimization (Tasks 21-30)
**Goal**: Production-ready core
- Performance optimization
- FAISS integration
- Error handling
- Memory management

### Phase 4: API & Service (Tasks 31-40)
**Goal**: Complete service
- FastAPI implementation
- REST endpoints
- Monitoring
- Documentation

## Documentation Cross-Reference

I will constantly reference:
1. **PRD Sections**: Technical specifications, architecture, performance targets
2. **Qiskit Documentation**: Circuit creation, simulation, optimization
3. **PennyLane Documentation**: Hybrid training, gradient computation
4. **PyTorch Documentation**: Classical ML components
5. **Research Papers**: Quantum algorithms, similarity metrics

## Task Dependencies Mapping

```
Foundation Tasks (01-10)
    ↓
Core Engine Tasks (11-20)
    ↓
Optimization Tasks (21-30)
    ↓
API & Service Tasks (31-40)
```

Each phase builds on the previous, with clear handoff points and validation criteria.

## Quality Assurance

Each task includes:
- **Code quality**: Following best practices
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and external docs
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **Performance**: Benchmarking against targets
- **Modularity**: Clean interfaces and separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Generate Phase 1 foundation tasks (01-10)
2. Create detailed implementation plans
3. Validate against PRD requirements
4. Ensure all documentation is referenced
5. Set up clear success criteria

This methodology ensures systematic, documentation-driven development with clear milestones and testable progress.
