# Task QRF-03: Implement Proper Two-Stage Retrieval Testing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing framework for two-stage retrieval (FAISS → Quantum Reranking) to properly evaluate quantum methods as rerankers rather than just similarity replacements.

## Problem Statement
Previous tests compared similarity methods directly rather than testing quantum as a reranker in a proper two-stage pipeline:
- Direct similarity comparison doesn't reflect real RAG usage
- No validation of FAISS → Quantum reranking effectiveness
- Missing evaluation of quantum's impact on final document ranking
- No testing of quantum's selective advantages (noise, complexity, etc.)

## Two-Stage Retrieval Pipeline

### Stage 1: FAISS Vector Search
- Fast initial retrieval from large document corpus
- Returns top-K candidates (typically 50-100)
- Uses classical embedding similarity
- Optimized for recall, not precision

### Stage 2: Quantum Reranking  
- Reranks FAISS candidates using quantum methods
- Returns final top-N results (typically 10-20)
- Optimized for precision and relevance
- Adds quantum advantages: noise handling, semantic depth

## Implementation Plan
