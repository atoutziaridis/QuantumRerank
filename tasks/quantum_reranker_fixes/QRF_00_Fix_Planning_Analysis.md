# Task QRF-00: Quantum Reranker Fix Planning and Analysis

## Overview
Comprehensive analysis and planning for fixing quantum reranker performance issues identified through real-world testing with PMC medical articles.

## Problem Statement
Based on diagnostic testing with real PMC Open Access XML articles, the quantum reranker shows:

1. **Pure Quantum Fidelity Saturation**: Returns scores ~0.999 with minimal discrimination (0.001 differences)
2. **No Quantum Advantage**: Classical methods consistently outperform quantum methods
3. **Performance Regression**: Previously reported 61% quantum advantages not reproducible
4. **Implementation Issues**: Quantum methods slower (2-4x) without accuracy benefits

## Root Cause Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Quantum Fidelity Computation Problem
- **Symptom**: Pure quantum returns 0.997-1.000 for all text pairs
- **Impact**: Zero discrimination between relevant/irrelevant documents
- **Root Cause**: Quantum state encoding likely produces states too similar to each other
- **Evidence**: Even completely different domains (diabetes vs computer science) show 1.000 similarity

#### 2. Untrained Quantum Parameters
- **Symptom**: Random quantum circuit parameters don't capture medical semantics
- **Impact**: Quantum kernels perform no better than random
- **Root Cause**: No training on medical corpus, no KTA optimization applied
- **Evidence**: Hybrid methods only work when heavily weighted toward classical

#### 3. Two-Stage Retrieval Not Properly Tested
- **Symptom**: Previous tests compared similarity methods, not reranking pipelines
- **Impact**: Not testing quantum as intended reranker
- **Root Cause**: Test design focused on similarity scores rather than ranking quality
- **Evidence**: Need FAISS → Quantum reranking pipeline validation

#### 4. Amplitude Encoding Issues
- **Symptom**: Quantum states may not properly encode semantic differences
- **Impact**: All quantum states appear nearly identical
- **Root Cause**: Normalization or encoding method flattens semantic distinctions
- **Evidence**: High-dimensional embeddings compressed to 4 qubits lose information

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
