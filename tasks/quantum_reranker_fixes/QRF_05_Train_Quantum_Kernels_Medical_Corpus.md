## Training Dataset Specification

### PMC Medical Corpus Analysis
Based on available PMC articles, create comprehensive training dataset:

```python
# Medical corpus analysis and preparation
class MedicalCorpusAnalyzer:
    def analyze_domain_distribution(self, pmc_articles):
        # Current PMC corpus: 100 articles
        # Domain distribution: 76 general, 9 neurology, 10 oncology, 4 diabetes, 1 respiratory
        # Need to balance training across available domains
        
    def create_balanced_training_set(self):
        # Generate query-document pairs from each domain
        # Ensure balanced representation despite skewed distribution
        # Create domain-specific training subsets
        # Generate cross-domain training examples
```

### Training Pair Generation Strategy
Create diverse query-document pairs for quantum kernel training:

```python
# Training pair generation for medical domains
class MedicalTrainingPairGenerator:
    def generate_query_document_pairs(self, articles):
        # Intra-domain pairs (same medical specialty)
        # Cross-domain pairs (different medical specialties)
        # Hierarchical pairs (general medical vs specific)
        # Temporal pairs (different time periods if available)
        
    def create_relevance_labels(self, query, document):
        # Domain relevance (cardiology, neurology, etc.)
        # Keyword overlap (medical terminology)
        # Semantic relevance (related medical concepts)
        # Clinical applicability (practical medical relevance)
```

**Training Data Targets:**
- **5,000 query-document pairs** from available 100 PMC articles
- **Balanced domain representation** despite skewed distribution
- **3-tier relevance labels**: Highly relevant (0.9), Moderately relevant (0.6), Not relevant (0.1)
- **80/10/10 train/validation/test split**

## Quantum Kernel Training Pipeline

        # Medical entity recognition (diseases, treatments, drugs)
        # Domain classification features
        # Clinical terminology density
        # Semantic embedding projections
        
    def optimize_for_quantum_encoding(self, features):
        # Apply mRMR feature selection for quantum compatibility
        # Reduce dimensionality for 4-qubit encoding
        # Preserve medical semantic information
        # Optimize for kernel discrimination
```

### Stage 2: KTA Optimization on Medical Data
Implement KTA optimization specifically for medical quantum kernels:

```python
# KTA optimization for medical quantum kernels
class MedicalKTAOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, quantum_kernel_engine):
        self.kernel_engine = quantum_kernel_engine
        self.medical_kta = KernelTargetAlignment()
        
    def optimize_medical_parameters(self, medical_pairs, relevance_labels):
        # Optimize quantum circuit parameters to maximize KTA
        # Use medical query-document relevance as target
        # Apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithm)
        # Validate on medical ranking tasks
        
    def medical_specific_optimization(self):
        # Domain-specific optimization (cardiology, neurology, etc.)
        # Terminology-aware optimization
        # Clinical relevance optimization
        # Cross-domain generalization
```

### Stage 3: Multi-Domain Validation
Validate quantum kernel performance across medical domains:

```python
# Multi-domain validation for medical quantum kernels
class MedicalDomainValidator:
    def validate_across_domains(self, trained_kernels):
        # Test on neurology queries and documents
        # Test on oncology queries and documents  
        # Test on diabetes/endocrine queries and documents
        # Test on general medical queries
        # Measure cross-domain transfer performance
        
    def evaluate_clinical_relevance(self):
        # Evaluate on clinical information needs
        # Test on diagnostic vs treatment queries
        # Validate on different levels of medical complexity
