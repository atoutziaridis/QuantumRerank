# Quantum Reranker Fix Tasks - Summary Overview

## Task Series: QRF (Quantum Reranker Fixes)

This task series addresses critical issues identified in quantum reranker performance through comprehensive real-world testing with PMC medical articles.

## Problem Summary

### Key Issues Identified
1. **Pure Quantum Fidelity Saturation**: Returns ~0.999 scores with no discrimination
2. **No Quantum Advantages**: Classical methods consistently outperform quantum
3. **Implementation Problems**: Amplitude encoding, SWAP test, parameter training
4. **Testing Inadequacy**: Not properly testing quantum as reranker in two-stage pipeline

### Impact Assessment
- Quantum methods provide no measurable improvement over classical
- Previously reported 61% quantum advantages not reproducible
- Performance regression from early quantum implementations
- Production deployment blocked by lack of quantum benefits

## Strategic Approach

### Technical Strategy
1. **Fix Fundamentals First**: Address core quantum fidelity and encoding issues
2. **Build Proper Testing**: Implement comprehensive two-stage retrieval evaluation
3. **Train on Real Data**: Use PMC medical corpus for domain-specific optimization
4. **Validate Advantages**: Identify specific scenarios where quantum helps
5. **Deploy Selectively**: Use quantum only where it provides measurable benefits

### Risk Management
- **Parallel Development**: Run QRF-01, QRF-02, QRF-03 in parallel to reduce risk
- **Incremental Validation**: Test improvements at each stage
- **Fallback Options**: Maintain classical methods as backup
- **Early Detection**: Stop if no quantum advantages found after Phase 2

- Meeting production performance targets (enables deployment)

## Decision Points

### After QRF-01 (Week 1): Continue/Pivot Decision
- **Continue**: If quantum fidelity discrimination >10x improvement
- **Pivot**: If fundamental quantum encoding issues cannot be resolved

### After QRF-05 (Week 3): Quantum Viability Decision  
- **Continue**: If trained quantum shows >10% improvement over classical
- **Stop**: If no quantum advantages found despite proper training

### After Phase 3 (Week 6): Production Decision
- **Deploy**: If quantum provides clear advantages in specific scenarios
- **Archive**: If quantum cannot justify production deployment costs

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Begin QRF-01, QRF-02, QRF-03 in parallel
