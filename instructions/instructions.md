**Universal Coding Prompt for QuantumRerank Project**
-----------------------------------------------------

* * * * *

**IMPORTANT:**\
Whenever you generate code or complete a task for this project, **follow these instructions in order:**

* * * * *

### **1\. Documentation-First Approach**

-   **You have access to these documentation folders:**

    -   `/Users/alkist/Projects/QuantumRerank/docs/documentation`

    -   `/Users/alkist/Projects/QuantumRerank/docs/Papers Quantum Analysis`

-   The **second folder contains summarized/analyzed research papers.**

    -   **Always prioritize reading these when implementing any new feature or module.**

-   Before generating code, **determine which paper(s) or architectural docs are most relevant to the current task** based on their names and the context of the prompt.

-   **Read and understand the relevant documentation** from these folders as the *first step before any coding.*

* * * * *

### **2\. Analyze the Code Base**

-   **Examine the current state of the code base** and any existing implementation, modules, or interfaces.

-   Make sure new code fits well with existing patterns and architecture.

* * * * *

### **3\. Analyze the Prompt**

-   **Carefully read my latest prompt/request.**

-   Extract all requirements and clarify any ambiguous points if needed.

* * * * *

### **4\. Make a Targeted Plan**

-   **Before coding,** outline a *step-by-step, modular plan* describing how you will implement or change the code.

-   Specify which files/modules will be created or edited, and the intended purpose of each.

* * * * *

### **5\. Generate Code**

-   **Proceed to implement the code**, following your plan.

-   Use best practices for modularity, clarity, and reusability.

-   **Reference the documentation and the plan as you code.**

* * * * *

**Summary of Folders for Documentation:**

-   `docs/documentation` *(general technical documentation and architecture)*

-   `docs/Papers Quantum Analysis` *(preferred folder for summarized/analyzed research papers)*

* * * * *

**ALWAYS follow the above steps, in this order, for every generation or code task.**

* * * * *

*Important notes: !!!*
**If you are unsure which paper or document is most relevant for the task, or how to interpret any part of the documentation, ask for clarification before proceeding.**

**Make sure that all the tests generated are properly organized. Make sure that we don't leave any scrap or redundant code outside. Make sure that everything is clean, organized, lean.**

*Don't just bunch all the files together. Make sure you have a proper structure. Make sure the code is modular. Make sure you're following the coding best practices. Make sure that the code base is understandable. Make sure that you don't make redundant code.*

**Don't keep adding garbage code. Make sure that all your code additions are thought about, and that you're not just adding stuff just to add. And you're not just adding features just to add them as bolt-on garbage stuffâ€”or you're hallucinating that it works and it doesn't.**
