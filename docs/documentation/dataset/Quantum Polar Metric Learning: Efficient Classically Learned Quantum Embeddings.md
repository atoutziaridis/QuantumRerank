Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL): Detailed Breakdown
=========================================================

**1\. Motivation & Context**
----------------------------

### **Why do we need this?**

-   **Classical deep metric learning** works great for separating features (think: getting good embeddings for retrieval/classification).

-   **Quantum Metric Learning (QMeL)** tried to adapt this by encoding classical features onto quantum states, hoping to leverage Hilbert space for better separation.

-   **BUT:**

    -   Existing QMeL methods are inefficient---need too many qubits, too much circuit depth (bad for today's "NISQ" quantum hardware).

    -   Classical-to-quantum mapping (e.g., angle encoding, amplitude encoding) either wastes Hilbert space, or is hard to optimize, and doesn't "fit" real-world data well.

### **Key challenge:**

How do you encode classical data into quantum states *efficiently*---using as few qubits/gates as possible---while still getting meaningful improvements in separation or retrieval?

* * * * *

**2\. What QPMeL Proposes**
---------------------------

### **Core Idea:**

-   **Classically learn the *polar* form of a qubit** for each embedding. That is, for each qubit, you predict two parameters:

    -   **ùúÉ (theta):** For Y-rotation

    -   **ùõæ (gamma):** For Z-rotation

-   Use a *shallow* quantum circuit (Ry, Rz, and trainable entangling ZZ(ùõº) gates) to encode those into a quantum state.

-   **Train with a quantum triplet loss:**

    -   Use SWAP test in the circuit to measure *state fidelity* between anchor, positive, and negative triplets.

    -   Loss is formulated in Hilbert space, but gradient flows back into the classical network (so everything can be trained end-to-end).

-   **Quantum Residual Correction (QRC):**

    -   During training, have extra learnable "residual" parameters for Ry/Rz angles that act as noise barriers---improving stability and speed.

### **Main contributions:**

-   Efficiently encodes with *2 angles per qubit* (polar encoding) instead of full amplitude encoding or angle encoding.

-   Circuit is *half as deep* and uses *half as many gates* as prior QMeL.

-   Defines a *fidelity triplet loss* for quantum learning.

-   Outperforms both QMeL and equivalent classical networks on multiclass separation.

* * * * *

**3\. Architecture Overview**
-----------------------------

### **A. Classical Head**

-   **CNN backbone** (for images; MLP for other data): learns feature representations.

-   **Angle Prediction Layer (APL):**

    -   Takes features and outputs two real-valued vectors (ùúÉ and ùõæ), one per qubit.

    -   Sigmoid activation, then multiplied by 2œÄ2\pi2œÄ for full rotation range.

### **B. Quantum Encoder**

-   **For each sample:**

    -   Start with |0‚ü©‚äón

    -   For each qubit, apply:

        -   Ry(ùúÉ)

        -   Rz(ùõæ)

    -   Add a layer of ZZ(ùõº) entangling gates (parameters are trainable).

-   **Residual Correction:**

    -   During training, extra ùúÉ_Œî and ùõæ_Œî terms (learnable) are added to angles, acting as "noise shields."

    -   These are merged into the classical network at inference.

### **C. Fidelity Triplet Loss (FTL)**

-   **For each triplet (anchor, positive, negative):**

    -   Encode anchor, positive, and negative into quantum states (using same circuit).

    -   Use SWAP test to compute state fidelity between (anchor, positive) and (anchor, negative).

    -   Loss = max(ùëì(Anchor, Negative) - ùëì(Anchor, Positive) + margin, 0)

    -   This pushes positive pairs close in Hilbert space, negatives far apart.

* * * * *

**4\. Key Technical Details**
-----------------------------

### **Why "Polar Encoding"?**

-   Each qubit's state on the Bloch sphere is parameterized by two angles (polar form):

    ‚à£œà‚ü©=cos‚Å°(Œ∏/2)‚à£0‚ü©+eiŒ≥sin‚Å°(Œ∏/2)‚à£1‚ü©|\psi\rangle = \cos(\theta/2)|0\rangle + e^{i\gamma}\sin(\theta/2)|1\rangle‚à£œà‚ü©=cos(Œ∏/2)‚à£0‚ü©+eiŒ≥sin(Œ∏/2)‚à£1‚ü©
-   **Dense angle encoding:** Encodes two features per qubit (more efficient than just angle or amplitude encoding).

### **Why is this better?**

-   *Efficient*: Fewer qubits needed, less circuit depth = more robust on noisy quantum hardware.

-   *Expressive*: Utilizes more of Hilbert space (compared to "flat" classical space), enabling richer separation.

-   *Practical*: End-to-end differentiable (trainable with classical optimizers).

* * * * *

### **Quantum Residual Correction (QRC)**

-   Training with sigmoids (for angles) and quantum circuits can make gradients "vanish" (plateaus).

-   QRC adds trainable offsets to Ry/Rz angles during training to help gradients flow---acting as a "noise barrier."

-   These parameters are absorbed back into the classical layer for inference.

* * * * *

### **Quantum Triplet Loss**

-   Uses quantum fidelity (state overlap, measured by SWAP test) as a distance metric.

-   This loss forces positive pairs to have *high* state overlap (fidelity near 1), negative pairs to have *low* overlap.

* * * * *

**5\. Analysis & Experimental Results**
---------------------------------------

### **Efficiency**

-   Compared to QMeL:

    -   Uses **1/2 the gates**

    -   **1/2 the circuit depth**

    -   **~30% fewer classical parameters**

    -   **3√ó better multi-class separation** (stronger "decision boundaries" in Hilbert space)

### **Separation**

-   In experiments (MNIST):

    -   Heatmaps show better class separability than classical and previous quantum baselines.

    -   Even the *classical head* trained with quantum loss produces better separation than with classical loss!

### **Ablation (Why does it work?)**

-   No residual QRC ‚Üí separation gets much worse (proves QRC is critical).

-   Only classical triplet loss ‚Üí worse than quantum loss (proves quantum loss is better for this metric learning task).

### **Interpretation**

-   The quantum circuit acts as a "learnable kernel function" (RKHS style).

-   The classical network "learns how to best use the quantum circuit" for separation.

-   QPMeL enables you to train deep classical models with a quantum similarity metric, potentially improving generalization.

**6\. Practical Implementation (How You'd Use It)**
---------------------------------------------------

1.  **Choose your data** (images for paper, but works with text embeddings if MLP used instead of CNN).

2.  **Classical model:**

    -   Outputs 2 angles per qubit (for n qubits = 2n outputs).

    -   Sigmoid, scale to [0, 2œÄ].

3.  **Quantum circuit:**

    -   For each sample, Ry and Rz gates per qubit, then ZZ entangling gates.

    -   Residual parameters added for training.

4.  **Triplet loss training:**

    -   Build batches of (anchor, positive, negative) samples.

    -   Forward through classical head ‚Üí quantum encoding ‚Üí measure fidelities (via SWAP test) between (anchor, positive) and (anchor, negative).

    -   Compute triplet loss (with margin).

    -   Backpropagate all the way through the quantum circuit (using parameter-shift rule) and classical head.

5.  **Inference:**

    -   Remove QRC residuals; inference just uses classical outputs as quantum angles.

**7\. Key Takeaways & Implications**
------------------------------------

-   **QPMeL is *practical* for NISQ-era quantum computers**:

    -   Uses minimal quantum resources, so it can scale.

    -   Classical model does heavy lifting---quantum circuit used for what it's good at.

-   **Shows quantum loss functions can help classical networks:**

    -   You can use quantum similarity to drive better representation learning, even in the classical network.

-   **Can be adapted for text/embedding data:**

    -   Instead of CNN, use MLP or transformer to produce the 2n angle outputs.

**8\. How You Might Adapt for Your Project**
--------------------------------------------

-   Replace your current MLP ‚Üí quantum parameter mapping with this polar angle approach.
