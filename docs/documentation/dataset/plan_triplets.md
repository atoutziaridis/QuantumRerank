### **How to Use NFCorpus with Your QuantumRerank**

1.  **Download NFCorpus**

    -   HuggingFace Datasets: NFCorpus

    -   Or Original Source (Uni Hannover)

2.  **Preprocess:**

    -   Encode queries and documents using SentenceTransformers (as you do now).

    -   Split into train/val/test.

3.  **Train Your Predictor:**

    -   Use the *query-document relevance* pairs as triplets for triplet loss (anchor=query, positive=document, negative=random non-relevant doc).

    -   Train your MLP+quantum circuit pipeline using these examples.

4.  **Evaluate:**

    -   Use ranking metrics: NDCG@10, MRR, Recall@50.

    -   Compare quantum, cosine, and hybrid reranking.

5.  **Analyze "semantic gap" cases:**

    -   Pay special attention to queries where classical ranking fails but quantum/hybrid does better.

### **Bottom Line**

-   **NFCorpus is perhaps the most relevant, "stress-test" dataset for your current goal.**

-   You don't need a huge GPU or cloud server.

-   Results here will be meaningful for both research and potential real-world impact.

-   If your quantum reranker *ever* shows improvement, it will be on a dataset like this.
