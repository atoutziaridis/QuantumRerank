# 5. MLOps for Quantum-Classical Systems 🔄 MEDIUM PRIORITY

Current Gap: Standard MLOps practices may not apply to quantum-classical hybrid systems.
Research Needed:
Quantum Model Versioning: How to version quantum circuits and parameters
Hybrid System Monitoring: Monitoring quantum circuit performance in production
Quantum A/B Testing: Testing quantum vs classical similarity methods
Circuit Drift Detection: Identifying when quantum circuits degrade in performance
Quantum CI/CD: Continuous integration/deployment for quantum code

Below is a structured research plan addressing each gap, with pointers to existing tools, techniques, and open challenges. Wherever possible, links to relevant literature and software are provided.

1. Quantum-Circuit and Parameter Versioning
    - Challenge: Unlike classical code, quantum “source” includes both circuit topology and continuous gate parameters.
    - Approaches \& Tools
– Git + QASM/Qiskit snapshots: Store each circuit’s QASM or Python definition in source control; tag releases with semantic versions[1].
– Data-Version-Control (DVC): Track associated parameter-sets (e.g. variational angles) and training metadata as data artifacts[2].
– Hashing circuit descriptors: Compute a canonical hash of the compiled circuit DAG (nodes=gates, edges=temporal ordering) to detect rewrites[2].
    - Open Questions
– How to diff continuous parameters robustly? (e.g. thresholded “semantic diff”)
– Integration with cloud backends to snapshot hardware-specific transpilation outputs
2. Hybrid System Monitoring
    - Challenge: Production quantum-classical workflows require end-to-end observability (circuit failures, shot counts, latency, classical optimizer metrics).
    - Approaches \& Tools
– Qiskit Runtime sessions expose job progress and backend metrics via SDK[3].
– QOPS: Profile-guided feedback for circuit performance on simulators, extended to capture system-level metrics (queue time, requeue rates)[4].
– Prometheus + Grafana: Instrument classical driver code to export metrics; collect backend health (T1,T2, error rates) from cloud-provider APIs[5].
    - Open Questions
– Unified schema for hybrid trace across quantum and classical steps
– Anomaly detection on time-series of quantum job metadata (adapting drift-detection methods like in Ref. 27)
3. Quantum A/B Testing
    - Challenge: Comparing two algorithmic variants (quantum vs classical similarity subroutines) under stochastic sampling.
    - Approaches \& Tools
– Quantum Maximum Mean Discrepancy (QMMD): Kernel-based two-sample test on quantum-computed kernels achieves linear scaling versus quadratic for classical MMD[6][7].
– Quantum-A/B framework: Run both versions on matched shot budgets and apply classical two-proportion z-test on pass/fail criteria[7].
– Amplitude-estimation-based A/B: Use amplitude estimation to reduce variance in p-value estimation for quantum tests[8].
    - Open Questions
– Design of “null” experiments to calibrate type-I error under drift and noise
– Multiple comparisons correction when testing many quantum-classical pairs in parallel
4. Circuit-Drift Detection
    - Challenge: Identify when the hardware+algorithm performance degrades over time.
    - Approaches \& Tools
– Ramsey-style time-series: Execute short diagnostic circuits (e.g. idle Ramsey or randomized-benchmarking sequences) interleaved with applications; compute per-epoch drift spectra via time-resolved GST[9][10].
– Continuous monitoring via test-points: Insert mid-circuit measurements on designated “watch” qubits to detect local decoherence changes on-the-fly[11].
– Statistical process control (SPC): Apply CUSUM or EWMA charts to rolling error-rate estimates from RB results[9].
    - Open Questions
– Minimally-invasive drift tests for dynamic-circuit workflows
– Automated correction triggers (e.g. mid-circuit recalibration) when drift threshold crossed
5. Quantum CI/CD
    - Challenge: Automate build, test, and deployment of quantum workflows in a reproducible pipeline.
    - Approaches \& Tools
– GitHub Actions + Q-Deployment: Use modified OpenAPI spec to package quantum services and deploy via Docker[12][13][14].
– Qiskit Code Assistant: Automate transpilation, dynamic-circuit branch tests, and regression of primitive outputs across QPUs[15].
– Terraform + Qiskit-Runtime: Provision QSCOUT or IBM Q instances and run session/batch jobs as IaC.
    - Open Questions
– Handling queue fluctuations and retries in automated tests
– Versioning of both code and transient calibration data (e.g. per-run error maps)

Next Steps

1. Pilot a Git+DVC workflow for a variational-quantum circuit project, tracking both QASM and parameter CSVs.
2. Instrument a Qiskit-Runtime session to emit Prometheus metrics for job latency, shot success, and classical optimizer loss.
3. Implement a quantum-MMD test comparing a quantum-kernel similarity measure against its classical counterpart on a financial data set.
4. Deploy mid-circuit “test point” circuits to an IBM Q device at hourly intervals and apply SPC limits to detect drift.
5. Build a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions that triggers on pull requests to transpile circuits at 4 optimization levels and runs a suite of diagnostic circuits.
