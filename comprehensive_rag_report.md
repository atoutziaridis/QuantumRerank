## Conclusion

This comprehensive real-world testing demonstrates that **classical similarity methods remain superior** for semantic retrieval tasks. While quantum-inspired approaches offer theoretical promise, current implementations show significant performance gaps that prevent production deployment.

The **Classical Cosine similarity** emerges as the clear winner, offering:
- Highest quality (0.826 NDCG)
- Fastest processing (4.8s average)
- Consistent performance across query types
- Production-ready reliability

**Quantum methods** require fundamental algorithmic improvements before becoming viable alternatives. The 49% performance penalty observed across all query types indicates systemic issues rather than fine-tuning problems.

For immediate production deployment, we recommend the **Classical Cosine** method with continuous monitoring for performance regression and opportunities to integrate improved quantum algorithms in future iterations.
