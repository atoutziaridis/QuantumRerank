# QuantumRerank Incident Response Playbook

## Overview

This playbook provides structured procedures for responding to production incidents in the QuantumRerank system. It covers incident classification, response procedures, communication protocols, and post-incident analysis.

## Incident Severity Classification

### P0 - Critical (Response: Immediate, Resolution: 1 hour)
**Service Impact**: Complete outage or severe degradation affecting all users
- Service completely unavailable (>5 minutes)
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach or unauthorized access
- Error rate >25% for >2 minutes
- Response time >2000ms for >5 minutes

**Examples**:
- All API endpoints returning 500 errors
- Kubernetes cluster down
- Database completely inaccessible
- SSL certificate expired
- Quantum computation engine completely failing

**Response Team**: All hands on deck
**Communication**: Immediate notification to all stakeholders

### P1 - High (Response: 30 minutes, Resolution: 4 hours)
**Service Impact**: Significant degradation affecting many users
- Error rate >10% for >5 minutes
- Response time >1000ms for >10 minutes
- Single replica/node failure affecting capacity
- Cache completely unavailable
- Memory usage >95% for >5 minutes

**Examples**:
- Similarity computation failing for quantum method
- Batch processing timeout errors
- Auto-scaling not responding to load
- Primary cache cluster down
- Performance severely degraded

**Response Team**: On-call engineer + senior backup
**Communication**: Notify engineering team and management

### P2 - Medium (Response: 2 hours, Resolution: 24 hours)
**Service Impact**: Minor degradation with workarounds available
- Error rate >5% for >15 minutes
- Response time >500ms for >30 minutes
- Non-critical feature unavailable
- Monitoring alerts triggered
- Memory usage >80% for >30 minutes

**Examples**:
- Specific API endpoint slow but functional
- Cache miss rate elevated
- Non-critical monitoring endpoint down
- Performance metrics collection issues
- Single pod repeatedly crashing but others healthy

**Response Team**: On-call engineer
**Communication**: Notify engineering team

### P3 - Low (Response: 24 hours, Resolution: 1 week)
**Service Impact**: Minimal impact, cosmetic issues
- Documentation issues
- Non-critical monitoring gaps
- Enhancement requests
- Minor performance optimizations needed

**Examples**:
- Grafana dashboard display issues
- Log formatting problems
- Non-essential metrics missing
- Documentation outdated

**Response Team**: Assigned engineer during business hours
**Communication**: Standard issue tracking

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

**1.1 Incident Detection**
- Automated alerts (Prometheus/AlertManager)
- Monitoring dashboard abnormalities
- Customer reports
- Team member observation

**1.2 Initial Assessment (0-5 minutes)**
```bash
# Quick health check
curl -f https://api.quantumrerank.com/health
./scripts/health-check.sh comprehensive

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n quantum-rerank
kubectl get svc -n quantum-rerank

# Check recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/quantum-rerank -n quantum-rerank

# Check system resources
kubectl top pods -n quantum-rerank
kubectl top nodes
```

**1.3 Severity Assessment (5-10 minutes)**
- Determine incident severity using classification above
- Assess scope of impact (percentage of users affected)
- Identify primary symptoms and affected components

**1.4 Initial Communication (10-15 minutes)**
```

## Runbook Templates

### Template: API Unavailable (P0)

**Symptoms**: API returning 5xx errors, health checks failing

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n quantum-rerank -o wide

# 2. Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints quantum-rerank-service -n quantum-rerank

# 3. Check recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/quantum-rerank -n quantum-rerank

# 4. Check logs for errors
kubectl logs -n quantum-rerank -l app=quantum-rerank --tail=100 | grep -i error
```

**Mitigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. If recent deployment, rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --type kubernetes

# 2. If pod issues, restart
kubectl rollout restart deployment/quantum-rerank -n quantum-rerank

# 3. If resource issues, scale up
kubectl scale deployment quantum-rerank --replicas=6 -n quantum-rerank

# 4. Verify resolution
./scripts/health-check.sh comprehensive
```

### Template: High Error Rate (P1)

**Symptoms**: Error rate >10%, partial service degradation

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check error distribution
kubectl logs -n quantum-rerank -l app=quantum-rerank --since=30m | grep -i error | sort | uniq -c

# 2. Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n quantum-rerank

# 3. Check external dependencies
curl -f https://api.quantumrerank.com/health/detailed

# 4. Check rate limiting
kubectl logs -n quantum-rerank -l app=quantum-rerank --since=30m | grep -i "rate limit"
```

**Mitigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. If resource constrained, scale up
kubectl scale deployment quantum-rerank --replicas=5 -n quantum-rerank

# 2. If external dependency issue, enable fallbacks
# Update configuration to use classical methods only temporarily

# 3. If specific endpoint failing, consider disabling temporarily
# Route traffic away from failing endpoint
```

### Template: Performance Degradation (P2)

**Symptoms**: Response times elevated but under critical thresholds

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Run performance validation
python deployment/validation/performance_validation.py

# 2. Check resource trends
kubectl top pods -n quantum-rerank --sort-by=memory
kubectl top pods -n quantum-rerank --sort-by=cpu

# 3. Check cache performance
kubectl exec -n quantum-rerank deployment/redis -- redis-cli info stats

# 4. Check for memory leaks
kubectl logs -n quantum-rerank -l app=quantum-rerank | grep -i "memory\|gc"
```

**Mitigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Clear cache if low hit rate
kubectl exec -n quantum-rerank deployment/redis -- redis-cli FLUSHALL

# 2. Scale up if resource constrained
kubectl scale deployment quantum-rerank --replicas=4 -n quantum-rerank

# 3. Restart pods if memory leak suspected
kubectl delete pod -n quantum-rerank -l app=quantum-rerank
```
